          <h2><u>Biography:</u></h2>
          <p class="animate">My name is Rodrigue Kongne Mousob. I am a cameroonian born architect living in Poland.</p>
          <h2><u>Relevant information:</u></h2>
          <p>
            I am an architect and a painter currently based in Krakow, Poland. I
            am fluent in French, English, Polish and Russian.
          </p>
          <p>
            I discovered my passion for architecture during my teenage years,
            and it was further nurtured by the scholarship I earned, which
            provided me with the opportunity to study abroad. Throughout my
            seven-year journey at Tambov State Technical University, I not only
            acquired the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue my dream
            profession but also uncovered an unexpected talent and passion for
            painting.
          </p>
          <h2><u>Why Alt_school:</u></h2>
          <p>
            As an architect, I’ve always been passionated about problem-solving,
            design, and innovation. Transitioning to tech allows me to expand my
            creative boundaries and work on solutions that impact the digital
            world. I chose AltSchool Africa because of its practical,
            project-based learning approach and strong focus on software
            engineering. AltSchool’s curriculum is designed to equip me with
            in-demand tech skills, while its community-driven environment
            provides the support and mentorship I need to thrive in the tech

            technical expertise, enabling me to build a meaningful career in
            tech.
